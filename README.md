# Cryo-EM AI Analysis with MONA

## Overview
This repository provides an AI-based pipeline for analyzing Cryo-EM images using deep learning and MONA. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and inference steps for Cryo-EM image classification and segmentation.

## Features
- **Preprocessing:** Normalize and prepare Cryo-EM images.
- **Deep Learning Model:** A CNN-based model for feature extraction and classification.
- **MONA Integration:** Utilize MONA for advanced Cryo-EM image analysis.
- **Visualization:** Tools for exploring results and model predictions.
